Transfer learning using the AfSIS large-scale spectral library
================

## Motivation

Soil spectral libraries (SSLs) are becoming larger and more diverse.
This implies a shift from more general machine learning (ML) approaches
to transfer learning in order to maintain predictive accuracy in
comparison to more local modeling. Transfer learning is a concept
established in the mid-90ties, which is gaining popularity in various ML
and deep learning application domains.

The African Soil information service AfSiS . QED is developing an
excellent infrastructure for the a SSL together with wet chemistry
measurements, where some data can be found [on this Amazon AWS cloud
image](https://registry.opendata.aws/afsis/). The explorations shown
here builds upon [this
tutorial](https://github.com/qedsoftware/afsis-soil-chem-tutorial):

The spectroscopic community has so far tested two main types of transfer
learning, with promising results:

## Technical notes

``` bash
# Install packages in coda environment in terminal
conda env create -n afsis-transfer -f environment.yml
```
